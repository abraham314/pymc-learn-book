If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable(head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

His interests involve developing principled probabilistic models for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, he is interested in flexible probabilistic machine learning methods, such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as Bayesian optimization &amp; Model-based Reinforcement Learning. He is also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at UNLV where his research in nonparametric Bayesian methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
