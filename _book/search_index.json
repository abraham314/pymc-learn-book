Pull requests and general comments are welcome. Practical Probabilistic Machine Learning with Python is (e.g. ???), data science (e.g. ???) and package development (e.g. ???). How to Get the Book To build the book: Install the latest version of R If you are using RStudio, make sure thatâ€™s up-to-date as well Install the book dependencies. # Make sure you are using the latest version of `devtools` # Older versions do not work. devtools::install_github(&quot;pymc-learn/pymc-learn-book&quot;) Clone the pymc-learn-book repo If you are using RStudio, open index.Rmd and click Knit. Alternatively, use the bundled Makefile Author Daniel Emaasit is a Data Scientist at Haystax Technology. His interests involve developing principled probabilistic models for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, he is interested in flexible probabilistic machine learning methods, such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as Bayesian optimization &amp; Model-based Reinforcement Learning. He is also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at UNLV where his research in nonparametric Bayesian methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
