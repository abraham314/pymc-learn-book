# Welcome {-}

<img src="figures/sylvain_marechal.jpg" alt="figures/sylvain_marechal.jpg" width="400"/>

This is the [online version](https://pymc-learn.github.io/pymc-learn-book/) of the book: [Practical Probabilistic Machine Learning with Python](). Pull requests and general comments are welcome.

*Practical Probabilistic Machine Learning with Python* is [e.g. @chang2012r], data science [e.g. @grolemund_r_2016] and package development [e.g. @Wickham_2015].

## How to Get the Book {-}

To build the book:

1. Install the latest version of R
    * If you are using RStudio, make sure that's up-to-date as well
1. Install the book dependencies.
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    # Make sure you are using the latest version of `devtools`
    # Older versions do not work.
    devtools::install_github("pymc-learn/pymc-learn-book")
    ```
1. Clone the pymc-learn-book [repo](https://github.com/pymc-learn/pymc-learn-book)
1. If you are using `RStudio`, open `index.Rmd` and click `Knit`.
    * Alternatively, use the bundled `Makefile`

## Author {-}

[Daniel Emaasit](http://www.danielemaasit.com/) is a Data Scientist at [Haystax Technology](https://www.haystax.com). His interests involve developing principled [probabilistic models](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, he is interested in [flexible](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) [probabilistic machine learning](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) methods, such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as [Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2599) & [Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06491).

He is also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at [UNLV](http://www.unlv.edu/) where his research in [nonparametric Bayesian](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
